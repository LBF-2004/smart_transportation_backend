Overview
The Smart Transportation Backend is the core server-side component of a smart transportation system. It provides APIs for managing and optimizing transportation routes, handling real-time data from various sources, and ensuring seamless integration with other components of the system. The goal is to improve the efficiency of transportation networks and enhance the user experience.

Features
Route Optimization: Efficiently calculate and manage transportation routes.
Real-time Data Handling: Process and store real-time data from various sensors and sources.
API Integration: Provides RESTful APIs for communication with frontend applications and other services.
User Management: Manage users, roles, and permissions within the system.
Data Analytics: Analyze transportation data to provide insights and reports.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for backend development.
Django: High-level Python web framework used to build the backend services.
Django REST Framework: Powerful toolkit for building Web APIs.
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing and managing data.
Celery: Distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks.
Redis: In-memory data structure store used as a message broker for Celery.
Docker: Containerization platform used for deploying and managing the application.

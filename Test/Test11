This is a full quote for anything you may need/require some of course may not apply to your specific run.  We give full quotes so there are no surprises.  If we have to use an outsourced chassis, you are subject to pay different chassis rates to match theirs.
 
*** Please note that sometimes we do not know where your empty container returns until we submit empty billing to the steamship line, so fees may not apply until then. ***
 

***New customers MUST have a credit card form and vendor app filled out and returned prior to first run before we can start the run until terms are set up with our Counteracting department.  If it is not, we are not guaranteed to get your run done nor a container pulled from the rail if it is on the LFD.  Also, if you pay by credit card and have detention time or other charges, we will charge your card after we send your POD.  Thank you. ***

 
Please let us know if we can help assist.  Thank you.

**Please note starting 10/24/16 any dry runs to depot, rail yard, or drop facility will be a TBD fee, we try our best to prevent any issues and to keep our drivers moving a

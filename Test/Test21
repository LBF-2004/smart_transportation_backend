Hi Vivian â€“
This will be an estimate based on the details listed below. Textiles have a freight class based on the density of the freight, so we will need to have the exact dimensions of the pallets (including height) in order to determine the density and class.
 
From  TX 75261  to  TX 76710. CFS pickup (limited access). Commercial delivery with dock or forklift to unload.
4 pallets (48x40x42); total weight: 3,554 lbs. freight class: 70 (textiles by density).
 
Central Freight (1-3 business days): $220.51.
AAA Cooper (1-2 business days): $329.92.
Estes Express (1-2 business days): $358.90.
 
Transit time is estimated. CFS pickups are not guaranteed.
Central is not the most reliable carrier.
